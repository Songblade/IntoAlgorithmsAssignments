     * Given the name of a class that implements the BigOMeasurable API, creates
     * and executes instances of the class, such that by measuring the resulting
     * performance, can return the "doubling ratio" for that algorithm's
     * performance.
     * <p>
     * See extended discussion in Sedgewick, Chapter 1.4, on the topic of
     * doubling ratio experiments.
     *
     * @param bigOMeasurable name of the class for which we want to compute a
     *                       doubling ratio.  The client guarantees that the corresponding class
     *                       implements the BigOMeasurable API, and can be constructed with a
     *                       no-argument constructor.  This method is therefore able to first construct
     *                       instances of this class, invoke "setup(n)" for whatever values of "n" are
     *                       desired, and then invoke "execute()" to measure the performance of a
     *                       single invocation of the algorithm.  The client is responsible for
     *                       ensuring that invocation of setup(n) produces a suitably populated
     *                       (perhaps randomized) set of state scaled as a function of n.
     * @param timeOutInMs    number of milliseconds allowed for the computation.  If
     *                       the implementation has not computed an answer by this time, it should
     *                       return NaN.
     * @return the doubling ratio for the specified algorithm if one can be
     * calculated, NaN otherwise.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if bigOMeasurable parameter doesn't
     *                                  fulfil the contract specified above or if some characteristic of the
     *                                  algorithm is at odds with the doubling ratio assumptions.
